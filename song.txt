Take your eyes off me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending
We have been here before
But I can't stay this time
'cause I don't love you anymore

Please stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind

I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ahhh yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah everything changed me.
